Uber Project:
Welcome to the Uber Project! This is a Java-based project that simulates a simplified version of a ride-hailing system, inspired by apps like Uber. It includes features like user registration, ride requests, driver management, and more.

Technologies and Concepts Covered:

Through this project, I worked with and gained experience in:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing and implementing classes to manage different aspects of the system.
Basic Data Structures: Using lists, maps, and arrays to organize and manipulate data efficiently.
Problem-Solving: Simulating real-world scenarios like user registrations, ride assignments, and route management.
Java Programming: Strengthening my skills in Java, including writing modular and reusable code.
This project demonstrates a practical understanding of how complex systems like ride-hailing services are built and operate at scale.

What This Project Does:

User Registration: New users can sign up and log in.
Request Rides: Users can book rides, and available drivers are assigned.
Driver Dashboard: View driver profiles, ride history, and ratings.
City Map: Simulates routes for rides within a city.
Service Management: Tracks active and completed rides.
This project is a great way to showcase Java programming skills, particularly with object-oriented design and basic data structures.

What’s Inside the Project?

Here’s a quick overview of the key files:

The src/ directory contains the source code for the project with this files:

UberUI.java: Handles the main user interface where users interact with the system.
UberService.java: The "brain" of the system – manages rides, users, and drivers.
Registered.java: Manages user registration and login functionality.
CityMap.java: Represents the city layout and handles routes for rides.
Other Java files: Support different parts of the system, like tracking users and drivers.

The `resources/` folder contains:
- **Sample Input Files**: Example input files for testing.
- **Sample Test Scripts**: Scripts for automated testing.

Usage Example:
Run the program with sample inputs provided in `resources/SampleInputFiles/`.
